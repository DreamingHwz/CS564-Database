# CS564-Database

This is the repository for [CS 564 Minirel Project](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/courses/564/minirel-project/), which build a working single-user DBMS that can execute certain simple SQL queries. I took the CS564 Database Manage Systems: Design and Implementation, fortunately guided by Professor [Paris Koutris](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~paris/), during 2022 Fall semester at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Here are the project descriptions:
* [The Buffer Manager](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/courses/564/minirel-project/project-stage3.html)
* [The Minirel HeapFile Manager](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/courses/564/minirel-project/project-stage4.html)
* [Minirel Query and Update Operators](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/courses/564/minirel-project/project-stage6.html)
